This project needs to demonstrate my abilities in web dev as well as detail all the things that I am capable of
by describing th projects that I've done and the specific programming experience I've had with various programming
languages

Because I wish to demonstrate a deep understanding of front end web dev technologies, I am going to only use vanilla CSS
and vanilla Javascript. It's the most effective method for showing what I really know. Besides, I don't really need
to add react, chakra, bootstrap or some other framework right now. However, I will try to incorporate different technologies
into my web page if possible.

For example:
If I wanted to demonstrate bootstrap to my website, all I need to do is import it into my scripts. Now, I'm not
totally sure where I would import it to. Bootstrap does seem to work based on simple class names, but I might need
to add it to a js file.
